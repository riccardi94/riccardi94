### WELCOME TO MY GITHUB PAGE üëã

I'm Emanuele, but you can call me Manu. Nice to meet you üòç

I'm a mechatronic engineering who is passionate about exploring new technologies. 

- üõ†Ô∏è I'm currently working as web developer for [Nethive](https://www.nethive.it/en/).
- üåê During my free time I like learning new things. Actually learning more about Python and NodeJs for increasing my backend attitude.
- üå≥ When I am not immersed in code, I'm out exploring new countries or do some hiking nearby where I live. 
- ü§ù If you want to collaborate for a project, feel free to [text me](https://www.linkedin.com/in/emanuele-raffaele-riccardi-b87962168/) .
